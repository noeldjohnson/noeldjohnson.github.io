<p> I'm a Professor in the Economics Department at George Mason University. </p>

<p> My research interests include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The historical origins of modern liberal institutions. You can purchase my book (written with Mark Koyama) here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1108441165/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Persecution & Toleration: The Long Road to Religious Freedom</a>. Here's a piece I wrote on why the cover of the book is cool: <a href="https://broadstreet.blog/2021/03/05/paintings-persecutions-and-political-development/">"Paintings, Persecutions, and Political Development"</a>. </li>

  <li>The relationship between state capacity and economic growth.</li>

  <li>The impact of environmental shocks on institutional change and economic and social outcomes.</li>

  <li>Applied Econometrics with a particular emphasis on spatial and text data.</li>

</ul>
