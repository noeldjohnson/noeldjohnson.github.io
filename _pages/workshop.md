The next iteration of the Economic History & Development Workshop will be held on 8 May 2020 at George Mason University's [Mercatus Center.](https://www.mercatus.org/) Please contact [Noel Johnson](mailto:noeldjohnson@mac.com) or [Mark Koyama](mailto:mark.koyama@gmail.com) or [Jenny Guardado](mailto:jennyguardado@gmail.com) if youâ€™re interested in presenting. I'll be posting a schedule here closer to May.

The purpose of the Workshop is to provide a low pressure environment for scholars to present early versions of their research.  Junior faculty and graduate students are especially encouraged to participate.
