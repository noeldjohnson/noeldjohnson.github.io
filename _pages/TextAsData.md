This is the webpage for the Spring 2020 informal seminar on Text as Data.

**Unfortunately, due to the Corona Virus shutdown of in person classes (and a massive increase in my childcare responsibilities) I'm cancelling the seminar for the rest of the semester. I hope to offer a for credit graduate course in this in Spring 2021. See you then...**
