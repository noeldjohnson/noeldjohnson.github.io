This is the webpage for the Fall 2019 iteration of Spatial Techniques in Empirical Economics.

Unfortunately, due to the Corona Virus shutdown of in person classes (and a massive increase in my childcare responsibilities) I'm cancelling the seminar for the rest of the semester. I hope to offer a for credit graduate course in this in Spring 2021. See you then...
