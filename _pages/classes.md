In the upcoming Fall Semester I'll be teaching Spatial Techniques in Empirical Economics ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzp6zw2e9pxpgqr/Spatial%20Syllabus%20Fall21.pdf?dl=0)) and U.S. Economic History ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2d5ejcafvj1gue/AEH%20Syllabus%20Fall21%20Version%202.pdf?dl=0)).

In Spring of 2022 I taught Text as Data and Maching Learning. The [syllabus for that class is here](/Users/noeljohnson/Dropbox/Teaching/TaD_Sp2022/syllabus/TaD_Sp22.pdf). I also taught a section of undergrad economic history. [The syllabus is here.](/Users/noeljohnson/Dropbox/Teaching/EH Spring 2022/Syllabus/EH Syllabus Spring 2022.pdf)

[//]: # (I'm teaching two sections of undergraduate economic history (Econ 365) this semester. If you're enrolled in either of these and are looking for class materials, they should be on your Blackboard account. The syllabus is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5pqdd7rk7uvs77s/EH%20Syllabus%20Spring%202021.pdf?dl=0).)
