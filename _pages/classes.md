In the upcoming Fall Semester I'll be teaching Spatial Techniques in Empirical Economics ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzp6zw2e9pxpgqr/Spatial%20Syllabus%20Fall21.pdf?dl=0)) and U.S. Economic History ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2d5ejcafvj1gue/AEH%20Syllabus%20Fall21%20Version%202.pdf?dl=0)).

In Spring of 2022 I taught Text as Data and Maching Learning. The [syllabus for that class is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o2md0t0quls2j2n/TaD_Sp22.pdf?dl=0). I also taught a section of undergrad economic history. [The syllabus is here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3n7nalqs20d5whd/EH%20Syllabus%20Spring%202022.pdf?dl=0).
