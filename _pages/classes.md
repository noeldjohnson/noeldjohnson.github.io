I'm teaching two sections of undergraduate economic history (Econ 365) this semester. If you're enrolled in either of these and are looking for class materials, they should be on your Blackboard account. The syllabus is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5pqdd7rk7uvs77s/EH%20Syllabus%20Spring%202021.pdf?dl=0).

If you're a GMU graduate student and wondering when I'll next teach spatial econometrics, hopefully this Fall (2021). The syllabus from Fall 2019 is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s2hdgkqjwjl13kf/Spatial%20Syllabus%20Fall19.pdf?dl=0).

I'll also probably teach graduate U.S. Economic History in Fall 2021. The syllabus from the Fall 2020 iteration is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbugz1kkycr6hed/AEH%20Syllabus%20Fall20.pdf?dl=0).

If you're here wondering when I'll next teach Text as Data as a formal class, hopefully Spring 2022. The syllabus from the informal seminar I led in Spring 2020 (until COVID intervened) is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/00hl6r5iniefpl6/TaD_Sp20.pdf?dl=0).
