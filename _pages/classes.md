I'm teaching two classes this semester: [American Economic History](https://noeldjohnson.github.io/aeh/) and [Spatial Techniques in Empirical Economics.](https://noeldjohnson.github.io/spatial/)

If you're looking for my tutorials on basic usage of ArcGIS, you can download them [here.](https://github.com/noeldjohnson/ArcGIS-Tutorial.git)
