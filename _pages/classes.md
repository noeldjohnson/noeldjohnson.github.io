In the Fall Semester I'm teaching Graduate U.S. Economic History ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6nnxf7lqm7q7o87c9r5yz/AEH-Syllabus-Fall23.pdf?rlkey=mzbkqmdkpf5bq18b50th4of64&dl=0)) and Undergraduate Development Economics ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/elajwhyabzzvdnwqw3ib6/Dev_Fall_2023.pdf?rlkey=o1pmgcp0rl803h0hu736v7w68&dl=0)).

Last Spring I taught Text as Data and Maching Learning. The [syllabus for that class is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o7qcvt9vbmni3gz/TaD_Sp23.pdf?dl=0).
