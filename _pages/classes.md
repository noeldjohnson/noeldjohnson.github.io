I'm teaching two classes this semester. Graduate U.S. Economic History and Undergrad Topics in Economic History. If you're enrolled in either of these and are looking for class materials, they should be on your Blackboard account.

If you're looking for my tutorials on basic usage of ArcGIS, you can download them [here.](https://github.com/noeldjohnson/ArcGIS-Tutorial.git)
