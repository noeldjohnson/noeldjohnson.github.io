In the Fall semester this year I'm teaching one section of Spatial Techniques in Empirical Economics ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzp6zw2e9pxpgqr/Spatial%20Syllabus%20Fall21.pdf?dl=0)) and U.S. Economic History ([syllabus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2d5ejcafvj1gue/AEH%20Syllabus%20Fall21%20Version%202.pdf?dl=0)).

If you're here wondering when I'll next teach Text as Data as a formal class, hopefully Spring 2022. The syllabus from the informal seminar I led in Spring 2020 (until COVID intervened) is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/00hl6r5iniefpl6/TaD_Sp20.pdf?dl=0).

If you're looking for my tutorials on basic usage of ArcGIS, you can download them [here.](https://github.com/noeldjohnson/ArcGIS-Tutorial.git)

[//]: # (I'm teaching two sections of undergraduate economic history (Econ 365) this semester. If you're enrolled in either of these and are looking for class materials, they should be on your Blackboard account. The syllabus is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5pqdd7rk7uvs77s/EH%20Syllabus%20Spring%202021.pdf?dl=0).)
